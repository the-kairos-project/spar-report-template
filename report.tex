% ABSTRACT (100-200 words)
% ============================================================================
% Provide an overview of your research question and why it matters for
% addressing risks from advanced AI. Describe your methodological approach
% and any preliminary findings. If working on technical safety or security,
% mention the specific threat model, vector, or vulnerability. Keep this
% accessible to readers outside your subfield. No footnotes or citations.

% ============================================================================
% INTRODUCTION (100-350 words)
% ============================================================================
% Describe the specific problem or question you're investigating and explain
% why it matters. Make clear what gap in existing work you're trying to fill
% or what risk you're addressing. Situate your project relative to existing
% approaches or prior work. Articulate what success would look like for your
% projectâ€”what would you need to demonstrate or discover for this research
% to be valuable?
\section{Introduction}

Introduce your research problem and explain its significance for AI safety. Describe the gap you're filling or risk you're addressing. Explain what success would look like for this project.

% ============================================================================
% METHODOLOGY (200-500 words)
% ============================================================================
% Describe your research approach clearly enough that someone could understand
% what you're doing and roughly replicate it. For empirical work, include your
% experimental setup, systems or datasets, and evaluation metrics. For
% theoretical work, outline your framework, key assumptions, and approach to
% arguments or proofs. For policy research, describe your research design,
% data sources, and analytical approach.
\section{Methodology}

Describe your research approach and methods.

% Example subsections (optional):
% \subsection{Experimental Setup}
% \subsection{Dataset and Evaluation}
% \subsection{Analysis Framework}

%     Approach A & 85\% & 2.3s \\
%     Approach B & 92\% & 4.1s \\

% ============================================================================
% PRELIMINARY RESULTS (200-500 words)
% ============================================================================
% Present what you've found so far. For empirical work, focus on quantitative
% findings with visualizations. For theoretical work, focus on key insights or
% partial results. For policy research, present initial findings from your
% analysis. Use subheadings if helpful. It's normal for midterm results to be
% incomplete.
\section{Preliminary Results}

Present your findings so far. Use subsections and visualizations as appropriate.

% ============================================================================
% CHALLENGES & OPEN QUESTIONS (100-300 words, optional but encouraged)
% ============================================================================
% Be honest about obstacles you've encountered: technical difficulties, resource
% constraints, or conceptual challenges. Note any areas where you're still
% figuring things out or where the path forward is uncertain.
\section{Challenges \& Open Questions}

Describe obstacles you've encountered and areas of uncertainty.

% ============================================================================
% NEXT STEPS (150-400 words)
% ============================================================================
% Highlight what you will focus on and what you will try to accomplish during
% the next half of the program. What will you prioritize? What might you
% deprioritize or cut if needed?
\section{Next Steps}

Describe your planned next steps for the remainder of the program. What will you prioritize?
